/*!
Traits enabling individual parameter parsing.

In [`debate`][crate], a [`Parameter`] is any type that can from (usually one)
command line argument, such as a string or integer. The trait allows these
primitive types to be parsed without consideration for whether they appear
as a `[POSITIONAL]` or `--flag=FLAG`.

The traits in this module form a hierarchy, with more specific traits being
easier to implement and enforcing common patterns, such as requiring arguments
or only appearing once. Each trait in the hierarchy automatically implements
the trait(s) below it.

The base [`Parameter`] trait applies to ANY parameter. It allows parameters
that are omitted, those that appear once or more than once, and those that
accept or deny arguments. Typically you only need to implement [`Parameter`]
for switches and switch-like types: `--flags` that don't accept arguments; it's
always preferable to implement [`PositionalParameter`] for types that accept
arguments.

The [`PositionalParameter`] trait applies to parameters that expect arguments,
such as positional parameters or `--flag=argument`. It still permits arguments
to be omitted, or to appear more than once. Individual types can enforce more
specific behaviors by implementing the relevant methods.

The [`Value`] trait is the most common: it applies to parameters that expect
*precisely one* argument; no more and no less. This applies to the common
primitive types like strings, paths, integers, and so on; a vast majority of
parameters are values. For this reason, [`Value`] is also used as a common
constraint for containers and wrappers; for instance, [`Option`] is a
[`PositionalParameter`], because it accepts 0 or 1 arguments, but it wraps
a [`Value`], since the inner type *must* accept an argument.

Finally, the [`ParsedValue`] trait is an empty utility trait that creates a
[`Value`] implementation from a [`FromStr`] implementation. This is an easy
way for you to add a [`Value`] implementation for your custom types, so long
as they implement [`FromStr`].

This module also defines an [`Error`] trait, allowing parameters to express
parsing or usage errors.

A required [`Parameter`] was absent from the command-line arguments.

This type contains no data because a parameter type doesn't have any additional
context about the field it's associated with. Generally a [`RequiredError`]
will trigger a [build error][crate::build::Error] to be created, which will
include more information about the field (such as its `--flag``).

This is a separate error from the [`Error`] trait, because it can only be
produced by [`Parameter::absent`], and there's no reason for
[`absent`][Parameter::absent] to ever produce any *other* error.

/**
Trait enabling conditional access to argument values when parsing the command
line arguments.

When parsing flags from the command line, the low-level parser can't know in
general whether a given argument is a standalone value, or whether it's an
argument to an earlier flag. For instance, given `--foo bar`, `bar` could be
a positional parameter, or it could be an argument to `--foo`, depending on
`--foo`'s type. This trait allows a [`Parameter`] implementation to

    result; it will return an [`Error::needs_arg`] if no argument was found.

    This method uses a callback rather than simply returning the argument to
    help enforce the requirement that a [`Parameter`] should either *always*
    expect arguments or *never* expect arguments; it shouldn't be able to
    behave in different non-error ways depending on the presence or absence of

/**
A parameter is a type that can be parsed from one or more command line
arguments and flags and so on.

The parameter trait allows types to operate independently of the field or
type of argument (option vs flag vs positional). It is the "type" part of the
command line argument, responsible for requesting arguments (if appropriate)
and parsing them into the underlying type.

A type should have a consistent behavior with regard to taking values; that is,
it should either ALWAYS or NEVER accept arguments. This ensures that the parse
behavior is as consistent as possible, with no weird ambiguities about options
vs arguments.

This is the lowest-level parameter trait, with the broadest range of
capabilities; usually it makes more sense to implement [`Value`] (for types
that take a value and appear exactly once) or [`PositionalParameter`] (for
types that take an argument, but may appear 0 or more times).
